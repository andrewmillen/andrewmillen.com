I have to admit that occassionally designing without regard for scope limitations or technical feasibility has always had its place in my process. Design is about solving problems, yes, but sometimes it’s about casting a vision. And casting a vision is critical when it comes to exploring emerging technology or funding early-stage startups.

## Augmented Reality

While the hardware is still bulky and awkward, the core promise of AR – embedding UI into our real-world context – is an idea I find exciting. It’s preferable to the alternative of, to borrow a phrase from Golden Krishna, <a href="https://www.nointerface.com/" target="_blank">slapping an interface on it</a>.

My approach is to explore AR applications in areas that are important to me: woodworking, cooking, and gardening. Each concept I’ve developed uses the technology to support and improve existing workflows in innovative ways, without feeling gimmicky or intrusive.

Bringing these visualizations to life pushed my skills as both a designer and a technologist in general. I borrowed from my experience as a 3D modeler and video editor, learning new workflows that crossed the spectrum of creative and technical software.

At the end of the day, these projects are just mockups. But that doesn’t mean they can’t have an impact. For the viewer, they spark ideas and connections that might otherwise take months to uncover. For me, they provide an opportunity to learn new software like Adobe After Effects and Blender, while also practicing interaction design and animation.

## HLPR

In the case of HLPR, the brainchild of local entrepreneur Jarad Bingham, the concept was the product – at least for the first round of funding.

The idea behind HLPR (”helper”) is to provide smartphone users with a cash-free way to help to people experiencing homelessness they may encounter on the street. To sell the idea to public officials and private investors, Jarad asked us to create an interactive prototype that demonstrates the vision better than he could with words alone.

The prototype takes the audience through the primary happy path of finding room at a local shelter for the recipient and hailing them a ride. Using Invision Studio, I created a high-fidelity prototype complete with onboarding, animated transitions, and realistic content that wowed in every board room pitch.
