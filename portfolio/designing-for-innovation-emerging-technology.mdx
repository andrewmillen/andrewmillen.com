## Interaction Design Concepts

While I'm a firm believer in problem-first design thinking, in due dillegence, in discovery, in process – I also think there's value in high level visualization early on in a project. Design is about solving problems, yes, but sometimes it’s about casting a vision. And casting a vision is critical when it comes to exploring emerging technology or funding early-stage startups.

Concepts like these are born out of simple questions that usually start with "What if?"

Creating these concepts trains design muscles. They're about studying what makes certain trends successful and what kinds of interactions we can build around. And they're fun!

In the case of HLPR, the brainchild of local entrepreneur Jarad Bingham, the concept was the product – at least for the first round of funding.

The idea behind HLPR (”helper”) is to provide smartphone users with a cash-free way to help to people experiencing homelessness they may encounter on the street. To sell the idea to public officials and private investors, Jarad asked us to create an interactive prototype that demonstrates the vision better than he could with words alone.

The prototype takes the audience through the primary happy path of finding room at a local shelter for the recipient and hailing them a ride. Using Invision Studio, I created a high-fidelity prototype complete with onboarding, animated transitions, and realistic content that wowed in every board room pitch.

## Augmented Reality

While the hardware is still bulky and awkward, the core promise of AR – embedding UI into our real-world context – is an idea I find promising. It’s preferable to the alternative of, to borrow a phrase from Golden Krishna, <a href="https://www.nointerface.com/" target="_blank">slapping an interface on it</a>.

My approach to learning AR is to explore applications in areas that are important to me, like woodworking. How can UI embedded in my environment support and improve my workflows? How can it be innovative without feeling gimmicky and intrusive?

While the video above is just a mockup, the skills learned in creating it are very real: 3D modeling, tracking, video editing – all skillsets that I've developed in service of becoming a better designer and more well-rounded technologist.

To make projects like this real, I've begun studying Apple's ARKit resources, learning new software and workflows, and working with developers to continue to expand my skillset.
