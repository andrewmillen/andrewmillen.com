## Early Design and Direction

As with most agency projects, our first job was to listen and learn. We studied the concept of good grief, the therapeutic services our clients provide, and the unique way they communicate with their audience. In the process, we were moved by one particular detail: At the end of each camp, participants release a yellow balloon, representing the loved one they’re letting go, into the sky. We knew immediately that we had to incorporate that imagery into the website.

As we moved on to the concept phase, it was my job as both the creative director and the developer to help Jen, the designer, unlock new ideas – then figure out a way to execute them. That meant moving beyond our usual static mockups. Jen created two diverging approaches and I animated them to give the client a better sense of which direction felt more right.

Both designs incorporate a yellow balloon motif, but the more literal interpretation was the favorite.

## Executing the Vision

To bring the winning concept to life in code, I used Javascript to animate the balloons so they would float away, strings waving in the wind. Jen then added an illustration of cloud cover for the balloons to emerge from, extending the visual metaphor and acting as a page divider – and I spruced it up with a parallax effect. To tie the rest of the website together, she created custom illustrations for each page and I brought them to life with ambient animations powered by Lottie, an SVG animation library.

Our close collaboration throughout resulted in a unique website that welcomes you to each new page with a calm, gentle character – distinctive and meaningful, but never overwhelming. Baptist Grief Center was thrilled with how the result spoke to their brand and their work.

Despite being a small project, this remains one of the most rewarding I’ve worked on in my career. Jen and I encouraged each other to push the envelope, to learn new things, and ultimately, we built a website that still holds up six years later – a lifetime in web design.
