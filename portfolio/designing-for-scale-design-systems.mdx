## From Zero to One

The first order of business was to create a new, comprehensive component library in Figma to power every design file. This took weeks of meticulous work, collaborating with the other designers to account for every known use case for each component. To minimize disruption and maximize adoption, we made changes to the existing design language only when necessary to improve consistency and accessibility.

In addition to actual design work, I supplemented the file with extensive documentation, including a guide for how the tokens in Figma would be translated into code.

As the design library reached maturity, I moved on to the process of getting each component built. With my background in front-end development, I was well suited to help our front-end team with the task: answering questions, writing acceptance criteria, reviewing every component – even pushing some code changes myself.

Starting with tokens, atoms, and then moving onto more complex molecules and organisms, we built a library of over 50 components in the first 12 months. By the end of that year, we were ready to build and launch the first set of pages in our new framework.

## Encouraging Adoption

To help encourage org-wide adoption of the new system, I helped write thorough and precise documentation for each component and its variants, as well as standards for things like forms, error messaging, loading states, date formatting, and all the little decisions that round out a successful design system. I even gave it a logo.

Helping it along, of course, requires some politicking. My approach to selling the importance of a design system is to constantly reinforce its business value to stakeholders: improved dev velocity, more business opportunities opened up with improved accessibility, and a path towards modernizing our entire UI. Often I found some in the organization didn't realize they were stakeholders until I shared the benefits of our investment.

## Envisioning the Future

One of the benefits of a centralized design system is the flexibility it provides when we want to make design updates across the whole product. Mariposa unlocks "UI 2.0" for OfficeSpace, which would be a completely new, modern, industry-leading design experience. To guide this initiative, I visualized an approach centered around accessibility – a problem area for OSS – with tokens, interactivity, and voice and tone layered around it.

To spread the vision further, the designers and I created revised versions of our key features using a potential new design language, generating excitement that gives Mariposa even more momentum. (Unfortunately, those mockups are proprietary and can't be shared here.)

Today, Mariposa is entering its adolescence as a design system, as it replaces existing pages, powers important new features, and grows in adoption across the entire organization.
